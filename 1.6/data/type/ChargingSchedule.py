duration integer 0..1 Optional. Duration of the charging schedule in seconds. If the duration is left empty, the last period will continue indefinitely or until end of the transaction in case startSchedule is absent.
startSchedule dateTime 0..1 Optional. Starting point of an absolute schedule. If absent the schedule will be relative to start of charging.
chargingRateUnit ChargingRateUnitType 1..1 Required. The unit of measure Limit is expressed in.
chargingSchedulePeriod ChargingSchedulePeriod 1..* Required. List of ChargingSchedulePeriod elements defining maximum power or current usage over time. The startSchedule of the first ChargingSchedulePeriod SHALL always be 0.
minChargingRate decimal 0..1 Optional. Minimum charging rate supported by the electric vehicle. The unit of measure is defined by the chargingRateUnit. This parameter is intended to be used by a local smart charging algorithm to optimize the power allocation for in the case a charging process is inefficient at lower charging rates. Accepts at most one digit fraction (e.g. 8.1)
