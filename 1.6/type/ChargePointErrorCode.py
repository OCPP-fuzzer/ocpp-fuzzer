    : EVCommunicationError : Communication failure with the vehicle, might be Mode 3 or other communication protocol problem. This is not a real error in the sense that the Charge Point doesnâ€™t need to go to the faulted state. Instead, it should go to the SuspendedEVSE state.
    : GroundFailure : Ground fault circuit interrupter has been activated.
    : HighTemperature : Temperature inside Charge Point is too high.
    : InternalError : Error in internal hard- or software component.
    : LocalListConflict : The authorization information received from the Central System is in conflict with the LocalAuthorizationList.
    : NoError : No error to report.
    : OtherError : Other type of error. More information in vendorErrorCode.
    : OverCurrentFailure : Over current protection device has tripped.
    : OverVoltage : Voltage has risen above an acceptable level.
    : PowerMeterFailure : Failure to read electrical/energy/power meter.
    : PowerSwitchFailure : Failure to control power switch.
    : ReaderFailure : Failure with idTag reader.
    : ResetFailure : Unable to perform a reset.
    : UnderVoltage : Voltage has dropped below an acceptable level.
